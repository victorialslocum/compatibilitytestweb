# Victoria's Compatibility Test
### my first Javascript project :smile:
this fun project was a great introduction to javascript and as with all of my projects so far, I learned a ton.   
   
I'm pretty happy with the end product, though I'm sure my code is a bit of a mess and not the most efficient. I hope to add and edit more as I learn.
